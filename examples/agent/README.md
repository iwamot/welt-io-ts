# Example Agent

The example agent for [Welt](https://github.com/iwamot/welt): the smallest complete agent that exercises the wire in both directions through @welt-io/strands.

## Stack

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| [Bedrock AgentCore SDK](https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-sdk-typescript) | Serves the endpoint |
| [Strands Agents SDK](https://strandsagents.com/) | Runs the model and the tools |
| @welt-io/strands | Adapts the wire to Welt |

## Run Locally

The agent runs on your machine as-is — [Welt's Quick Start](https://github.com/iwamot/welt#quick-start) starts here, before anything is deployed: the AgentCore SDK serves the same HTTP surface locally, on port 8080, that AgentCore Runtime serves in the cloud, and Welt's local mode invokes it there.

Fetch the agent and run it with Node.js 24, which runs TypeScript directly:

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iwamot/welt-io-strands-ts/main/examples/agent/src/main.ts
echo '{"type":"module"}' > package.json
npm install @welt-io/strands @strands-agents/sdk zod bedrock-agentcore
MODEL_ID=global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6 node main.ts
```

The process needs AWS credentials and a region the standard SDK way — environment variables, `AWS_PROFILE`, an SSO session — because the model runs on Amazon Bedrock. `MODEL_ID` takes any Converse model with access enabled in the Amazon Bedrock console; unset, the agent falls back to the Strands default (currently Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 through Bedrock's global inference profile, the same id as above) — enable access for it, or point `MODEL_ID` elsewhere.

One difference from the cloud: AgentCore Runtime gives every session its own microVM, while the local server is a single process for all sessions — the agent stashes an interrupted run in one slot, so keep interrupt experiments to one thread at a time.

## Deploy

Deploy with the [AgentCore CLI](https://github.com/aws/agentcore-cli):

```sh
agentcore create --name WeltExample --no-agent
cd WeltExample
agentcore add agent --name WeltExample --type create --build CodeZip --language TypeScript --framework Strands --model-provider Bedrock --memory none

curl -o app/WeltExample/main.ts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iwamot/welt-io-strands-ts/main/examples/agent/src/main.ts
npm --prefix app/WeltExample install @welt-io/strands zod

agentcore deploy
```

Note the agent runtime ARN from the deploy output: Welt's `AGENT_ARN` points at it.

## Tools

- `current_time` — the minimal tool: plain text streaming, nothing else. Ask "what time is it?" to see tool use in the thread.
- `attach_sample_file` — returns a document content block, which @welt-io/strands turns into a file upload in the thread. Ask it to attach the sample file.
- `sample_dangerous_action` — a pretend dangerous action (no side effects, no extra AWS permissions) that pauses for human approval: Welt renders the pause as **Approve** / **Cancel** buttons plus a free-text field in the Slack thread, and whichever answer comes first — a press, or a typed instruction — resumes the run. Ask "deploy to prod", then press a button or type something like "run the tests first". See [Welt's Interrupts doc](https://github.com/iwamot/welt/blob/main/docs/interrupts.md) for the round trip.

## Optional: file input

The agent can also read files uploaded to Slack — disabled by default. To try it, set in Welt's `.env`:

```sh
FILE_INPUT_MODALITIES=image,document
```

These two are what Claude models accept; `video` needs a model that takes video input — see [Welt's Files doc](https://github.com/iwamot/welt/blob/main/docs/files.md).
